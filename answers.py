   "The SAP smart forms tool is an excellent way to send and print important documents. I use this tool to create forms, emails, PDF files and documents that I plan to share with clients and coworkers online because it makes it easy to create the layout and maintain the logic of forms. It also allows me to make quick updates by using graphical tools instead of having to program changes manually. If I'm collaborating on a project with someone who isn't familiar with programming, this is especially important because the SAP smart tools allow them to enter data easily.There are also several form templates the SAP smart tools provide to streamline processes for sales and distribution (SD), customer relationship management (CRM), human resources (HR) and financial accounting."],

       "When the Garbage Collector gets called by the CLR to DE-allocate the memory in the heap, the Garbage Collector start finding the references of all the reachable objects which are currently in use. So it find the objects which are used by the processes and for rest of objects which are un-reachable or the Garbage collector is not able to find the references for them, it marks them for deletion.    Here the Garbage collector makes an Object graph which keeps track of all the objects which are marked for deletion. After the deleting the references for those objects, the heap memory gets compacted and a new root becomes available to use by the new created object. No, this object graph creates virtually by the Garbage Collector to keep all the objects and to make them for deletion. This is the Garbage Collector responsibility to create this object graph and gets the references of each reachable object which are used by the application",
       "The main difference between IIS and Kestrel is that Kestrel is a cross-platform server. It runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac, whereas IIS only runs on Windows.Another essential difference between the two is that Kestrel is fully open-source, whereas IIS is closed-source and developed and maintained only by Microsoft.IIS is very old software and comes with a considerable legacy and bloat. With Kestrel, Microsoft started with high-performance in mind. They developed it from scratch, which allowed them to ignore the legacy/compatibility issues and focus on speed and efficiency.However, Kestrel doesnâ€™t provide all the rich functionality of a full-fledged web server such as IIS, Nginx, or Apache. Hence, we typically use it as an application server, with one of the above servers acting as a reverse proxy. "
