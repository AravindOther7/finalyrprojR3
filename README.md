final year project

In order to apply for any kind of job the primary thing one person needs is the Resume.
A person is able to add anything he/she wants in their resume, but when the company goes through it, they can’t validate it,
they just have to assume all the things written on the resume are true and shortlist them based on that.
Thus,many people can get through the successive rounds just by mentioning the required keywords without possessing any real skillset.
The progression  of the project is to provide a solution for the represented problem statement That is to “Validate the Resume”. 
By conducting a test, providing and storing scores in a database, generating QR code in the resume through which the company can access 
the score and other information hence the validation authenticates or
provides some kind of credibility to the resume stating he/she is skilled in.
