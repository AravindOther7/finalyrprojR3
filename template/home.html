          In order to apply for any kind of job the primary thing one person needs is the Resume.
            <br><br>
          A person can add anything he/she wants in their resume, but when the company goes through it, they can’t validate it, they just have to assume all the things written on the resume are true and shortlist them based on that.
            <br><br>
          Thus,many people can get through the successive rounds just by mentioning the required keywords of the skills without possessing any real skillset.
            <br><br>
          The progression of the project is to provide a solution for the represented problem statement
            <br><br>
          That is to “Validate the Resume”.

        <div class="card-body text-left">
          Once the resume is uploaded to our system , it will extract the text in the resume using tesseract OCR and feed the
          extracted resume to our TF-IDF model which will determine the domain of the person who uploaded the resume, then a test link will be sent to the uploader’s email ( email Id will also be extracted from the resume , if email Id not present in the resume then it is considered to be invalid) , the uploader will take up the test through the link and the results will be stored in our database ,all the above validated information are stored in the system’s database.
          <br><br>
          A QR code will be generated and given with the resume which upon scanning will show the domain and all the validated data from the resume.
